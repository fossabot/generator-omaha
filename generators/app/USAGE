Description:
    Creates a web app work flow and infrastructure loaded with config files, templates and example files

Options:
    What do you want to name this project?
        Sets the project's name
    Where do you want to put the application directory?
        This allows you to nest the application files/folders in a directory of your choosing.
        By default, the project is scaffolded with app/assets/tasks/tests in the same directory as the project files.
        If a new project directory is designated, app/assets/tasks/tests will be put inside the the selected directory.
        This option is mainly intended for accommodating multi-app projects and could be considered "cleaner" by some.
    Auto-fix minor style errors?
        Sets the JSCS fix option (Y/N --> true/false)
    Detect copy-pasted and structurally similar code with JS Inspect?
        Installs JS Inspect and includes 'inspect' Grunt task
    Detect magic numbers with buddy.js?
        Installs buddy.js Grunt plug-in and adds buddyjs to 'lint' Grunt task
    Enforce ARIA and Section 508 standards?

    Use image compression for deployed application?
        Installs grunt-imagemin plug-in and includes image compression in 'build' Grunt task
    Integrate with Coveralls.io?
        Installs karma-coveralls module and adds sending coverage to Coveralls.io to the work flow
